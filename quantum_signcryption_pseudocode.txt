# SIGNCRYPTION

# Step 1: Generate keys
Generate (pk, sk) using Dilithium2 for signing and verification

# Step 2: Prepare a quantum message
Create a quantum circuit with one qubit
Apply a random rotation (Ry gate) for added randomness
Simulate the circuit to extract the quantum state |q>

# Step 3: Prepare a classical message
Define the classical message `m`

# Step 4: Generate a digital signature
Sign the classical message `m` using Dilithium2 and sk to generate signature `s`

# Step 5: Convert classical data to binary
Define a helper function to convert classical data into binary format
Convert classical message and signature to binary
Concatenate binary message and signature to form binary data

# Step 6: Encode binary data into quantum states
Define a function to encode binary data into qubits
Create a quantum circuit representing the encoded data

# Step 7: Create a combined quantum circuit
Define required qubit count and create a new quantum register
Remap qubits from the original quantum message and encoded binary data
Compose the quantum message and encoded data circuits into a single combined circuit

# Step 8: Reduce the combined circuit size for execution
Define maximum qubit count for testing
Remap and append a subset of operations to create a reduced circuit
Add measurement gates to the reduced circuit
